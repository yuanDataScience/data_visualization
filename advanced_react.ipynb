    "#### JSX, Components and Elements\n",
    "* JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript (JS)\n",
    "  + although looks like HTML, is a more powerful abstraction that combines both markup and business logic into an entity called a component\n",
    "* React uses JSX to describe UI appearance\n",
    "* elements in React\n",
    "  + what React does when you render JSX code\n",
    "    + analyzes your rendering methods from all your components\n",
    "    + takes the whole JSX tree, starting from the root and creates an intermediary representation similar to JSX DOM tree\n",
    "      + each node, instead of being JSX, is a plain JavaScript object describing a component instance or DOM node and its desired properties\n",
    "      + each of these objects is a React element. \n",
    "  + An element is a way to represent the final HTML output as a plain JavaScript object\n",
    "    + it consists of two attributes: type and props\n",
    "    + type defines the type of the node, such as a button. \n",
    "      + type can also be a function corresponding to a React component\n",
    "        + the type will have a value corresponding to the name of the component\n",
    "    + props encompasses all the properties the component receives in a single object\n",
    "    + elements can be nested as children atributes inside props\n",
    "    + root element specifies all the child elements as the children prop, and each child element does the same thing until it reaches the end of the tree\n",
    "    + both child and parent elements are just descriptions, not actual instances. They are easy to traverse and simpler than the actual DOM elements\n",
    "    + both React Components and DOM nodes can be nested and mixed with each other in the element tree\n",
    "      + this allows us to mix and match components and DOM elements as the type property without worrying about whether an element is a DOM node or component, and thus, decouples components from each other, and express their relationship through composition\n",
    "      + when React see an element with a function type, it will ask the component what element it renders to with the given props, and translate it to a DOM element. React will repeat this process for all components. This process generates the Virtual DOM\n",
    "        + real DOM is a JavaScript alternative representation of the real DOM\n",
    "* process of React\n",
    "  + produce a new UI representation as a tree of elements\n",
    "  + compare it with the previous representation that is kept in memory\n",
    "  + calculate the difference in a tree (each node is a JS object, this diffing operation is very fast)\n",
    "  + based on the difference, it will apply the minimum number of changes to the underlying DOM nodes to update the DOM tree\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Component composition with children\n",
    "* two main features that enable component composition: containment and specialization\n",
    "  + containment\n",
    "    + some components don't know their children ahead of time, such as a sidebar or a dialog (a type of modal window that disables rest of UI until the modal is addressed and interacted with)\n",
    "      + you can think of them as generic boxes\n",
    "      + the recommended approach is to use the child prop to pass the children elements directly as their content \n",
    "        + in the following code example, the ConfirmationDialog component uses the props.children prop to pass the children elements inside the dialog modal window\n",
    "  + specialization\n",
