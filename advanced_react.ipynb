    "    + generating keys in the app will have problem since the internal state of the items are not preserved. Each time when re-rendering the app, those keys will be different, resulting React having to recreate your list from scratch\n",
    "      + as a last resorts, you may use the item index as the key that can guarantee the absence of duplicates, but index should not be used to items where the order of items may change. For example, you sort your items, or users can remove and add items\n",
    "  + when not used properly, keys may negatively affect performance, and cuase the user interface glitches    \n",
    "  + when computing a change, react applies its stiffing algorithm to calculate the minimum number of changes that are necessary to perform an update in your tree of components\n",
    "  + there are situations that we will need to step in\n",
    "    + one example is that we update a list' items by inserting the item to the top of the list. React will update evey list element, rather than keeping all the existing records, and just shifting them, causing the efficiency problem\n",
