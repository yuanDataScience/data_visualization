    "   + you rely on some core components that are well tested\n",
    "   + where components are used in multiple places, you only need to update these components once \n",
    "   + develop SPA that only load content as required, they are suitable for apps that require \n",
    "     + SPA is a technology that loads a single web page and performs updates to the DOM on this single web page based on user interaction\n",
    "     + rich user interfaces\n",

    "     + scalability and flexibility\n",
    "* React.js overview\n",

    "    + each component has the required functionality that can be inserted into the app without requiring modification of other components\n",
    "    + components are reusable and can be used multiple times and easily inserted anywhere needed\n",
    "    + components can exist within the same space independently from each other\n",
    "    + many developers can work on the same project without interferering with other developers' components\n",

    "  + app component locates in index.js file in the source file folder\n",
    "  + every app should have at least one component, which is the root component\n",
    "    + this component in default app is app component\n",
    "    + this component is imported into the app\n",
